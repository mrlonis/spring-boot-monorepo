 * This is a basic test application to show how to set up a Spring Boot application with Testcontainers. It is used to

 * the local profile, but it uses Testcontainers to start up a MySQL database in a Docker container. This can easily be
 * run in IntelliJ by clicking the green arrow next to the main method and selecting Run 'TestApplication.main()'.
